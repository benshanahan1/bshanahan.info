                        <p>I am currently a Junior at Brown University in Rhode Island, where I am studying Neuroscience, among other things. When I have the occasional free moment, I love to draw, make music, code, build things with electronics, and go running, rock climbing, and biking.</p>
                        <p>At the moment, I am on a semester abroad, studying in Paris. The program is entirely in French and I have had quite the experience! Check out some of the <a href="gallery-paris" target="_blank">pictures</a> I've taken.</p>
                        <p>You can find my <a href="documents/Shanahan Benjamin 2015 Resume.pdf" target="_blank">resume</a> here.</p>
