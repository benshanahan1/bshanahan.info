                <h2>About me</h2>
                <p>I am currently a Junior at Brown University in Rhode Island, where I am studying Neuroscience, among other things. When I have the occasional free moment, I love to draw, make electronic music, program, build things with electronics, and go running, rock climbing, and biking.</p>
                <p>At the moment, I am on a semester abroad, studying in Paris. The program is entirely in French and I have had quite the experience! Check out some of the <a href="gallery-paris" target="_blank">pictures</a> I've taken.</p>

                <p>You can find my <a href="documents/Shanahan Benjamin 2015 Resume.pdf" target="_blank">resume</a> here, but I made this site so that it was a little more fun to see some of the stuff I've worked on...</p>
