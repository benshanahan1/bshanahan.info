                <h2>Open-Source Code Repository</h2>
                <p>Here you can find code that I have written over the years in a number of languages, it's all open-source, so if you're having trouble finding something or a particular program doesn't have a noncompiled version, just email me and I will be sure to sort things out.</p>
                <p>And here is a link to my <a href="https://github.com/benshanahan1" target="_blank">GitHub</a> for good measure although it's still a little empty at the moment... I am working on that.</p>

                        <li><a href="documents/matlab/getTilt.zip" target="_blank">getTilt.zip</a>: analyzes the coordinates of three points (e.g. three tracker LEDs on a rat's head) in order to determine if the rat's head is tilted or flat. Returns boolean operator indicating the tilt condition.</li>
                        <li><a href="documents/matlab/smsig.m" target="_blank">smsig.m</a>: simple function to smooth any signal using a Gaussian windowing algorithm, given the signal itself and the window size.</li>
                        <li><a href="documents/matlab/getfiles.zip" target="_blank">getfiles.zip</a>: obtain a list of files from a given directory and all subdirectories contained within.</li>
                        <li><a href="documents/matlab/deleteFileList.m" target="_blank">deleteFileList.m</a>: remove all files specified in a list. This list is the same one obtained in the previous getfiles() function listed above.</li>
                        <li><a href="documents/matlab/howToFilter.m" target="_blank">howToFilter.m</a>: simple reference for filtering signals, the file uses a Butterworth filter.</li>

                        <li><a href="documents/python/egcd.py" target="_blank">egcd.py</a>: implementation of extended euclidean algorithm in order to find both the GCD of two numbers and Bezout's Identity. This code was written for a Python Programming course at the Pierre et Marie Curie University in Paris.</li>

                        <li><a href="documents/actionscript/QuickCode.zip" target="_blank">QuickCode.zip</a>: encoder/decoder I made a while back; still fun to play with, works well for use in chatrooms. If you are interested in the code behind this, send me an email and I can dig it up for you. Please note that this program is not encrypting your data, and although the user can vary the key, the algorithm used is not secure at all.</li>

                        <li><a href="documents/java/Coder.zip" target="_blank">Coder.zip</a>: another encoder/decoder program, except implemented in Java. Please note that this is not encryption and is by no means secure at all.</li>
                        <li><a href="documents/java/RWFile.zip" target="_blank">RWFile.zip</a>: Java class for easily reading and writing text files.</li>
                        <li><a href="documents/java/Translator.zip" target="_blank">Translator.zip</a>: executable Jar program which reads in a text file of nucleotides and translates it to its corresponding amino-acid string. If you are interested in the code behind this program, send me an email, and I will see if I can find it for you. Note that this requires that you have the java development kit installed on your computer and that it be accessible via command line (added to your computer's environment path).</li>
