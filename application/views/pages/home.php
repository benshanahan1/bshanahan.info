                <h2>Welcome to my portfolio!</h2>
                <p>Here you can find more information about me, the projects I have done, the code I have written, and the adventures that I have been on.</p>
                <p>I apologize in advance, as the site is not yet fully completed, and I am still adding all of the information. I have chosen to push the live version so that there is something out there for those interested. Please continue to check back frequently, as I will be updating everything! :)</p>
