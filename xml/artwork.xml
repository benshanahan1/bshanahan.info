            <description>Graphic designs drawn with ink. Frequently I will scan my designs, vectorize them, and then colorize them with computer software such as Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator. My brother and I have silk-screened a number of our designs onto shirts with the intention of starting a small t-shirt company.</description>
